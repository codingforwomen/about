An introduction to Coding for Women

## Coding for Women

Founders & Coders runs a full-time no-fee coding bootcamp. This Meetup group is for the "Founders & Coders: Coding for Women" sessions which run fortnightly on a Tuesday, 6.30-8.00pm from 12th July.

The sessions are peer led paired coding supported by F&C cohort and focus on two main levels:

* Absolute Beginners (HTML,CSS, Git & Github, basic web development)
* F&C Applicants/Pre-course requisites (CodeWars, Javascript, READMEs etc. Full requisites [here](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/academy/)

## Resources
* [Here](https://github.com/codingforwomen/about/blob/master/Resources.md) are a list of useful free online learning resources to get you started.

## Inclusivity

We struggled to be inclusive in the name and appreciate "Coding for Women" isn’t perfect. For the meetup the word “Women” includes:

* non binary
* trans
* genderqueer
* or any other non cis gender identity
